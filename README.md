# USAccidentSeverityPrediction

**Introduction**

Each year, 1.35 million p.eople are killed on roadways around the world. Crash injuries are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally for all age groups and the leading cause of death for children and young people 5–29 years of age. More people now die in crashes than from HIV/AIDS.

Accidents are an unfortunate reality of our daily lives, impacting individuals, families, and communities across the United States. Understanding the causes, patterns, and consequences of accidents is of paramount importance for public safety, transportation planning, and policy-making. In this notebook, we delve into the world of accidents, specifically focusing on accidents that occur on the roads and highways of the United States.

**US Accidents Dataset:** Accurate and comprehensive data on accidents is essential for making informed decisions and improving safety measures. Fortunately, we have access to a rich and extensive dataset known as the "US Accidents" dataset. This dataset provides a wealth of information about traffic accidents that have occurred in various parts of the United States.

In this notebook, we will embark on a data exploration journey to gain insights into US accidents. We will employ data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and important factors associated with accidents.

We have decided to implement and compare 8 different models, the following are the models selected by us:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random forest
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Naïve bayes
5. CatBoost
6. Decision tree
7. AdaBoost
8. XGBoost

By addressing these questions and more, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of accidents in the US. Our analysis may provide valuable insights for various stakeholders, including government agencies, law enforcement, transportation authorities, and the general public, in their efforts to enhance road safety and reduce the frequency and severity of accidents.

Whether you are a data scientist, a traffic safety advocate, or simply someone interested in knowing more about the dynamics of accidents in the United States, this notebook is designed to inform and inspire. So, let's embark on this data-driven journey and explore the fascinating world of US accidents together.
